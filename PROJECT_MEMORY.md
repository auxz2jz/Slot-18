# Project Memory / Recovery Checkpoint
Date: 2026-10-07 (America/Los_Angeles)
Repository: auxz2jz/Slot-18
Canonical master rules: https://github.com/auxz2jz/master-instruction-library

## Status
- Project: Handheld Multi-Sensor Detection System
- Current task: initialize permanent project and start a software-only radar visualization/data-contract prototype
- Candidate: v0.1.0 — software-only demonstration, NOT a flashed ESP32 build
- Last user-verified version: NONE
- Latest legitimate artifact: repository main branch, pending initial project commit and explicit testing
- Hardware received/tested: NONE
- Hardware purchases: planned only; do not assume orders placed
- User direction: begin before hardware arrives; user will advise when available
- Cross-platform: browser prototype is a design harness; ESP32 firmware is the intended target. No Android/Windows app started.

## Confirmed design preferences
- Handheld 7-inch touchscreen ESP32-S3; operator may raise antenna array on a pole above head.
- Start with ONE each LD2450, DFRobot C4001 25m SEN0609, and C4002 SEN0691; evaluate SC16IS752 dual UART expansion.
- Later four cardinal directions / up to 12 radar modules, expandable to eight directions / up to 24 only after field coverage tests.
- Moving person X/Y tracking where available; stationary people / sleeping presence; approximate distance; overhead visualization.
- Five or more battery-powered remote ESP32 sensor stations possible, with GPS and heading/tilt sensors; map overlay and room/floor-plan view.
- Modular capability-based adapters for radar, thermal, GNSS/RTK, IMU/compass, LiDAR/depth, PIR, camera, magnetic, vibration, ultrasonic and door contacts.
- Prefer Amazon comparison listings, budget-conscious staged purchases, open-source tooling where practical.
- No internet or cloud required for local mode.

## Technical constraints / warnings
- All three candidate radar models share 24 GHz region; mutual interference must be measured.
- Indoor occupancy cannot be guaranteed; through-wall/through-floor detection unreliable and not suitable for emergency/security certainty.
- A person/hand holding the unit can shadow radar; walking induces apparent target motion; magnetometers require calibration.
- LD2450 track X/Y does not provide independent height. C4001 and C4002 presence/range must NEVER be plotted as exact dots.
- GPS locates outdoor stations, not radar targets; stationary GPS does not determine orientation; an IMU without a calibrated heading reference can drift.
- Screen's UART connector/jumper ports are shared; no untested assertion of available independent serial ports.
- The C4001 documentation mentions UART + I2C but exact SEN0609 wiring/firmware must be verified before relying on I2C.
- GNSS accuracy is not submeter by default; RTK requires correction service/base and sky view.
- All radars active continuously may drain a small battery rapidly. Power budget is not yet measured.
- Prototype is not a reliable life-safety or emergency location device.

## Actual implementation / verification
- Initial project scaffold + browser simulator created as candidate v0.1.0.
- Source files: prototype/index.html, style.css, core.js, app.js, test_core.cjs.
- Software build/automated-test status: not yet verified by user.
- Real display, radar, GPS, compass, mapping, firmware and battery runtime: NOT IMPLEMENTED.
- Known bugs/failed approaches: none documented yet; do not infer success before running tests.
- Diagnostic/test protocol in docs/DIAGNOSTICS_AND_TESTING.md.

## Exact next step after initial commit
1. Run node --test prototype/test_core.cjs and inspect behavior of prototype/index.html in a desktop/mobile browser.
2. Record result + commit SHA in project memory; ask user to verify UI concept when suitable.
3. Only after screen arrives: use official Waveshare ESP-IDF/LVGL sample to bring up capacitive touch, then port simulator view; avoid guessing GPIO.
4. Add LD2450 physical driver next; use separate guided tests and diagnostic captures.
